# Autoarr struct
`Autoarr` means Automatically resizing array. It is my implementation of dyynamic array. If you want to use `Autoarr` of some type, it should be declared in header file by macro `Autoarr_declare` and defined in source file by `Autoarr_define`.  
  
Examples:  
[Hashtable.h](src/Hashtable/Hashtable.h)  
[Hashtable.c](src/Hashtable/Hashtable.c)
